Nobody could have known that Jack had unwittingly embarked on the most incredible and unusual experience of his life.
Jack had turned 14 that day, and was beside himself! He could picture his mother waiting for him at home; she would hopefully be giving him the gift of his dreams:
His grandfather had been a scientist with a brilliant mind but a ‘Crackpot’ as Jack’s mother said. One day he packed up his lab and vanished, leaving only a mysterious gift for Jack, to be opened on his birthday. Today was that day.
Jack raced home, and practically snatched the package from his mother’s outstretched arms.
His look of curiosity turned to excitement and then euphoria. Although he didn’t know it yet, he was looking at something mysterious and incredible; the box of mathematics.
A note attached to the box’s base read:

Jack,
Listen well, we don’t have much time.
This box of mathematics belongs to you now.
Protect it from our enemies.
Without it, humanity cannot survive.
This box should never have left Pentagon Palace, you must return it. Only then can it be truly safe.
The box is a map of mathematics, an intricate puzzle with several pieces missing. You must recover these on your journey
Pieces can be recovered by solving puzzles set by the creatures you will meet on your journey
Fit the pieces in the box together to reveal your first destination, THE WORLD OF FIRE.
You will need the help of my inter-dimensional time machine and the old compass which works only in worlds far from here
Go into the attic, Jack, and enter the coordinates into the compass 00 00 00 00 00 00. Activate the lever to travel to the world of fire.
Good luck
And goodbye-
